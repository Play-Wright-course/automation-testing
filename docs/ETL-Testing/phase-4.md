# ETL Testing Techniques - In Depth

## 4. Common ETL Testing Techniques

ETL testing ensures the data loaded into the target system is correct, consistent, and follows business rules. Below are the key techniques explained with examples.

### 1. Source vs Target Testing

* **Purpose:** Compare the raw data in source and target to ensure **data completeness** and **accuracy**.
* **How to Test:**

  * Check row counts
  * Verify column values
  * Validate sums, averages, and key metrics

**Example:**
Source Data:

| Customer_ID | Sales_Amount |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 101         | 250          |
| 102         | 300          |
| 103         | 150          |

Target Data:

| Customer_ID | Sales_Amount |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 101         | 250          |
| 102         | 300          |
| 103         | 150          |

✅ Row count matches, values match → Pass

### 2. Transformation Validation

* **Purpose:** Verify that **all business rules and transformation logic** are applied correctly.
* **How to Test:**

  * Apply the same transformation rules manually or with SQL queries
  * Compare transformed values with the target system

**Business Logic Example:** Assign Loyalty Status based on sales:

* Sales >= 300 → Gold
* 200–299 → Silver
* < 200 → Bronze

**Transformed Target Data:**

| Customer_ID | Sales_Amount | Loyalty_Status |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 101         | 250          | Silver         |
| 102         | 300          | Gold           |
| 103         | 150          | Bronze         |

✅ Loyalty status correctly assigned → Pass

### 3. Metadata Validation

* **Purpose:** Ensure that the **structure of the target tables** matches expectations.
* **How to Test:**

  * Check column names
  * Validate data types (int, varchar, date, etc.)
  * Verify constraints (primary keys, foreign keys)

**Example:**

* Source column: `Customer_ID` (int) → Target column: `Customer_ID` (int)
* Source column: `Sales_Amount` (float) → Target column: `Sales_Amount` (float)

✅ Metadata matches → Pass

---

### 4. Incremental Load Testing

* **Purpose:** Test ETL jobs that **load only new or changed data** (delta loads) instead of full reload.
* **How to Test:**

  * Insert new rows into the source
  * Update existing rows
  * Delete some rows if required
  * Run ETL and verify only changed data is loaded into the target

**Example:**

* Original target has 3 customers
* New source record: Customer_ID 104, Sales_Amount 200
* After incremental load, target should have 4 records

✅ Only new/updated rows loaded → Pass

---

### 5. Regression Testing

* **Purpose:** Ensure existing ETL functionality **is not broken** after changes to ETL jobs or pipelines.
* **How to Test:**

  * Run ETL after modifications
  * Compare previous target data with new data
  * Validate business rules and transformations remain correct

**Example:**

* ETL logic updated to include a new discount column
* Verify existing Loyalty_Status calculations still produce the same results for previous records

✅ No unintended changes → Pass

---

**Summary:**

1. **Source vs Target:** Checks raw data accuracy and completeness
2. **Transformation Validation:** Ensures business rules are applied correctly
3. **Metadata Validation:** Verifies table structure, columns, and types
4. **Incremental Load Testing:** Tests delta/partial loads
5. **Regression Testing:** Confirms changes do not break existing ETL logic

These techniques form the core of ETL testing for any data pipeline.
