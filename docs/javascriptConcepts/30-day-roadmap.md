# 30-Day Study Plan: JavaScript Playwright Automation Roadmap

## Week 1: JavaScript Fundamentals

**Day 1**: Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`), data types  
**Day 2**: Operators (arithmetic, logical, `==` vs `===`), expressions  
**Day 3**: Template strings, string methods  
**Day 4**: Control statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
**Day 5**: Loops (`for`, `while`, `for...of`, `forEach`)  
**Day 6**: Functions (declaration, parameters, return), arrow functions  
**Day 7**: Mini-project: Implement a basic calculator using functions, conditionals, and loops

## Week 2: Advanced JavaScript & Data Structures

**Day 8**: Objects (creation, keys/values, nested objects)  
**Day 9**: Arrays (creation, methods: map, filter, find, includes)  
**Day 10**: Object and array destructuring, spread/rest operators  
**Day 11**: Review and practice: Manipulate test data with objects/arrays  
**Day 12**: JSON basics (`JSON.parse`, `JSON.stringify`, structure)  
**Day 13**: Read/write JSON files (Node.js `fs` module basics)  
**Day 14**: Mini-project: Store and retrieve test data in a JSON file

## Week 3: Browser Concepts & Asynchronous JavaScript

**Day 15**: DOM basics; selectors, query methods  
**Day 16**: How browsers process JavaScript; intro to Node.js  
**Day 17**: Promises; writing and resolving  
**Day 18**: Async/Await syntax; try/catch error handling  
**Day 19**: Review: Asynchronous patterns in sample scripts  
**Day 20**: Modules (`import`, `require`, exports)  
**Day 21**: Mini-project: Write a Node.js script using async functions to fetch and process JSON

## Week 4: Playwright Core APIs & Automation Practice

**Day 22**: Playwright setup (Node.js, NPM, install)  
**Day 23**: Creating your first Playwright test: launch browser, open page, selectors  
**Day 24**: Interacting with page elements: clicking, typing, navigation  
**Day 25**: Playwright locators, element lists, counting elements  
**Day 26**: Assertions, handling dropdowns/checkboxes, file uploads  
**Day 27**: Error handling (`try/catch` in Playwright scripts); writing custom error messages  
**Day 28**: Practice: Automate a login scenario with retries and validations  
**Day 29**: Page Object Model, organizing projects with utility functions, config files  
**Day 30**: Final Capstone: End-to-end test case (e.g., login, search, add to cart, logout) with reporting & debugging

## *Advanced Concepts and Continuous Practice*
- Explore ES6+ features, logging, and debugging (Playwright Inspector) as you build each week's project  
- Challenge yourself to refactor code and apply best practices like Page Object Model and modularization  
- Share progress or collaborate with peers online for feedback[web:11]

Save and use this plan for consistent daily study and practice. Each week concludes with a mini project or comprehensive review to reinforce real-world skills.
